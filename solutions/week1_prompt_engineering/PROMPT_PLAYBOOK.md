# Prompt Playbook v1

## Objective
Capture empirical observations comparing prompt variants and model behaviors. Use this as a living artifact you will refine in future weeks.

## How to Use This File
1. After each script run, append rows to the Results Table.
2. Tag failure modes (see legend) so patterns emerge quickly.
3. Summarize insights after completing stretch assignments.

### 1. Role Prompting

*   **Best Practice:**
    *   Clearly define the persona or role you want the AI to adopt. This helps to set the context, tone, and level of detail in the response.
*   **Example:**
    *   Instead of "Explain black holes," use "You are an astrophysicist. Explain the concept of a black hole to a curious 10-year-old."

---

### 2. Few-Shot Learning

*   **Best Practice:**
    *   Provide a few examples of the desired input and output format. This is especially useful for tasks like classification, summarization, or code generation.
*   **Example:**
    *   When asking for a summary, provide one or two examples of a text and its corresponding summary before providing the text you want to be summarized.

---

### 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

*   **Best Practice:**
    *   Encourage the model to "think step by step" or to "show its work." This is particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks, such as math problems or logic puzzles.
*   **Example:**
    *   Append "Let's think step by step" to your prompt when you need the model to reason through a problem.

---

### 4. Anti-Patterns to Avoid
## Reflection (End of Week)
Answer briefly:
1. Which two prompt patterns yielded the largest delta between models?
2. Which failure mode was most frequent? Root cause?
3. Default model choice for: explanation / reasoning / structure.
4. Open questions heading into Week 2.
*   **Ambiguity:**
    *   Avoid vague or open-ended questions. Be as specific as possible.
*   **Leading Questions:**
    *   Don't phrase your prompt in a way that suggests a desired answer.
*   **Overly Complex Prompts:**
    *   Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable prompts.
